## Week 1: Project Setup

**Planned Tasks:**
- Install Python (3.8+) and Django.
- Create Django project (`mysite`) and app (`todoList`).
- Configure `settings.py` and `urls.py` for the new app and static files.
- Create `Task` model with fields: `title`, `description`, `complete`, `created`, `deadline`, `user`.
- Run migrations to create database tables.
- Set up base templates (`base.html`) and integrate Bootstrap.

**Status:**
- Server could not run due to missing `todoList/urls.py`.
- Week 1 tasks are not fully complete; issue unresolved as further steps (views, forms) are required.
